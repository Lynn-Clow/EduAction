# EduAction
In the consideration that the college student behavior dataset is scarce, we set up a novel college studentsâ€™ action dataset in the classroom for attention estimation in this paper, named as EduAction dataset. We carefully analyze the source data and discover seven most common actions of college students in the real classroom environment: sleeping, listening to lectures, drinking water, talking with others, watching the computer, playing with mobile phones, and writing. The EduAction dataset consists of 7 types of actions and 718 action clips, collected in the real college classroom environment.
